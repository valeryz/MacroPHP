MacroPHP (Macro Processor for High Productivity) is intended to be a
lisp-like language that compiles into PHP.

Currently, there's a pretty-printer of sexp-based representation of a
PHP program into text.

The idea is, once the whole PHP is supported, write macroexpansion,
some additional "convenience" special forms, and use the language and
the host lisp to generate PHP code from declarative web site
descriptions.

This is all very raw, undocumented, and basically doesn't work yet.
