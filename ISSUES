* formatting of goto:
* macros can expand into code which contains control constructs in expression context!
  proposed solutions:
  1. detect this situation and bail out
  2. allow control constructs in expression context, and automatially
     transform the program to comply to PHP rules
  3. support contexts naturally.
  4. do nothing - macro writers will have to be careful.
