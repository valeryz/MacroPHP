* formatting of goto:
* nested progn formatting:
  PHP> (phpize '(if a b c d e))
  if (a)
	  b;
  else {
	  c;
	  d;
	  e;
  } 
  
  but 
  PHP> (phpize '(if a b (progn c d e)))
  if (a)
	  b;
  else
	  {
		  c;
		  d;
		  e;
	  }
* macros can expand into code which contains control constructs in expression context!
  proposed solutions:
  1. detect this situation and bail out
  2. allow control constructs in expression context, and automatially
     transform the program to comply to PHP rules
  3. support contexts naturally.
  4. do nothing - macro writers will have to be careful.
