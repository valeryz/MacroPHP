* DONE MacroPHP
 This is going to be a fantastic tool for PHP RAD!
** TODO find out what's going on with *symbol-print-names* printing on SBCL
** DONE PHP string literals should use single quotes wherever possible (if there's no \n \t etc) :mac:
** TODO think about test suite
** TODO look at weblocks and how they create declarative web site descriptions.
** TODO provide a nice syntax for double quote interpolation of variables
** DONE study the sources of CL-WHO and see if it can produce not only HTML but PHP code that produces HTML :mac:
    It seems this is not an option. But I can write something similar,
    e.g.
: (phpize t '(:ul (foreach ($a $x) (:li $x))))
    would evaluate to
      #+BEGIN_SRC php
        echo "<ul>";
        foreach ($a as $x) {
            echo "<li>";
            echo "$x";
            echo "</li>";
         }
       #+END_SRC
** TODO look at how parenscript implements HTML templating and so something similar
** study CL-SQL and see if we can at all use it to write out SQL statements and parts thereof :mac:
** TODO make forms classes						:mac:
** TODO make the forms generators and acceptors/validators		:mac:
** TODO make the ORM							:mac:
** TODO Scriptable PHP DOM						:mac:
